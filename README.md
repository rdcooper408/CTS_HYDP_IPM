# CTS_HYDP_IPM
Demographic model for the California tiger salamander that predicts population viability and non-native allele frequencies. 



This code can be used to run several simulations from the CTS Integral Projection Model developed by Cooper et al. (in review). 
This model simulates population demography based on the IPM developed by Messerman et al. 2023 but modified by Cooper et al (In review). 
The original IPM was modified to include empirical data from the hydroperiod study by Cooper and Shaffer 2024. Specifically, the model includes data on how hydrology and hybrid index score (HIS, percent non-native) affects survival and size at metamorphosis. This model also includes simulations to evaluate the efficacy of hybrid removal strategies. 

A version of the hybrid removal simulations can be run via an R shiny app here: https://rdcooper408.shinyapps.io/cts_ipm_shiny1/
